### Week 0
I installed Tools including VSCode, Github for Desktop, and Homebrew. Some notes and hacks:
- ./activate_macos.sh very important
- git pull —> update
- Site directory is generated!! (Through make process)
- All html, browsers love html
- .gitignore
- Never commit a dim file!! 
- Dem files are gitignore, all originals
- Don’t commit generated files
- .yml is data
- Don’t put data in code (abstraction)
- Name (key): John (value)
- baseurl is what you named repository
- Change theme —> change config.yml
- Readme —> how to use a theme
- Highlighted--> files added by someone else
- Ipynb —> interactive python notebook

In addition, I got into my partner pair and got to know them better.
