I cloned the repository again to amend my botched files. I figured out how to create the Submenu, linking it to tabs Course, About, and Table. I created a plan.

I added content to the Course, About, and Table md files. I also attempted to edit the table but it wouldn't let me for some reason. Reviewed [Build a Student Page](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c4.3/c5.0/2023/08/17/markdown-html_fragments.html 'Build a Student Page').

I edited the "view on Github" button to link to my own github and unlinked all of the files to add my progress log. I  committed my work to Github.
