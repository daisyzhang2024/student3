    "At Night at the Museum, we presented our project with a Hook, Project description, and separate minigames. I reviewed three other projects from CSA, and was especially impressed by a group's facial recognition emotion project, which could sense your emotion (happy/sad) and give you an inspiration quote. These inspiration quotes were stored in an API, or a sort of big library that the website could pull from. I was also impressed by a group's personal everything app which had a to-do list, planner, and weather-checker.\n",

    "## Trimester Reflection\n",
    "This trimester, I learned how to utilize basic markdown and code to build a website using Github Pages. I learned how to create my own blog, and connected javascript, css, and HTML to create comprehensive sites and games. In the beginning, I was supported by the teacher's code to build a snake game, game of life, and a calculator. Additionally, I contributed to our team game by helping implement sprites and collision mechanisms. I also added minigames from YouTube tutorials which used logic, if statements, and arrays. This helped me get a better intuitive understanding of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am still trying to work on having a more positive mindset towards code. I find myself putting off code and using extra time outside of class to do other things. I was overwhelmed by the code of my peers and the teacher's code and was struggling to break it down bit by bit. However, with help from YouTube and ChatGPT I was able to understand the code a bit better. I am still trying to learn how to \"think in code\" and get a better grasp of the basics of code. My next steps are to work on small projects, with the help of YouTube and also inspired by my own interests of reading, writing, and math.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, I want to work on more projects to strengthen my coding skills. I hope to incorporate more math and logic into various games, and some of my ideas include a probability game where you can calculate the probability to roll a certain number on two dice. I think it would also be fun to try and make a randome meme generator that generates random memes from a library (partly inspired by night of the museum). Overall, I would like to work on more projects that incorporate my interests and relate to my interests so I can be motivated to do them."
